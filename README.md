 I developed a fully responsive site using the React (18.2.0) and Bootstrap (5.2.3) frameworks. I utilized states and props in React to implement dynamic functionality, while leveraging the flexibility and user-friendly nature of Bootstrap to create a visually appealing and easily navigable website. 

Follow these Steps to install this react app:

1) Clone it and visit the root folder in terminal

2) Install the dependencies by running the following command
`npm i`
or
`npm install`

3) Launch the app using following command: 
`npm start`
